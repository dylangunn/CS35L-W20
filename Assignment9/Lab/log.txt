In server 7, ssh-keygen. Generates priv and pub key. Used a pass to encrypt.
Use ssh-copy-id -i gunnd@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu, enter pass, now public key stored for challenges.
From 7, "ssh gunnd@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu". Now, don't have to enter pass to ssh.
Can go into lnxsrv07 and ssh into lnxsrv06 without worrying about entering password. However, asks for passphrase!
If private key is encrypted with password, can't use it during challenge.
To fix this, use ssh-agent.
Run "eval $(ssh-agent)" to run an ssh-agent
Then: "ssh-add", says identity added.
Now, am able to ssh from server 7 into any other server.
To use them with X11, do "ssh -X lnxsrv##.seas.ucla.edu". Can now run X.
Test with xclock, works!
To daisy chain, do "ssh -A -t lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu ssh -A -t lnxsrv03.seas.ucla.edu"
    This works because -A enables agent forwarding and -t forces a psuedo-tty to be allocated, which allows an interactive shell session.
    This also makes it so if I log out while in 03, I will return to 07 rather than 06.
