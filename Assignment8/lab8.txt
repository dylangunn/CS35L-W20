1. cd into ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L
    Disk space to represent working files: "du -h" in directory.
    159M returned.

How much used to represent Git repo: "du -sh .git" in directory to get just
    sum of all files. Total of 350M.

What file(s) consume most of repo space, why: "du -a . | sort -nr | head -n 1    0"
    to print the 10 largest files. Appears to be:
    ./.git/objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.pack at
    311 MB. If we include the entire "pack" folder, it's 335 MB.

2. Number branches local to the repo: "git branch" lists all, pipe output to
    wordcount with "git branch | wc -l". 176 branches.

Number remote: "git branch -r | wc -l". 177 branches.

3. How many repos remote to this directory: "git remote" lists only origin.

4. 10 most recently committed branches? "git for-each-ref --sort=-committerda    te --count=10 --format="ref=%(refname)" refs/heads"

ref=refs/heads/master
ref=refs/heads/scratch/joaot/make-completion-at-point-function
ref=refs/heads/feature/windows-with-utils
refs/heads/scratch/completion-api
ref=refs/heads/scratch/a-modest-completion-redesign-proposal
ref=refs/heads/scratch/fido-mode
ref=refs/heads/feature/gnus-select2
ref=refs/heads/feature/extend_face_id
ref=refs/heads/scratch/jit-lock-antiblink-cleaned-up
ref=refs/heads/emacs-26

5. Number commits in master branch: "git rev-list --count master"
    139583

6. % commits in any branch are also in master: "git rev-list --count --all"
    139583/143910 = .9699

7. Top 10 authors of master-branch in 2013 or later, how many commits each?
"git shortlog -sn --since="31 Dec 2012"" bc "since" shows commits more recent     than a specific date.
Top 10:
  3692  Eli Zaretskii
  3655  Glenn Morris
  3606  Paul Eggert
  1806  Lars Ingebrigtsen
  1784  Stefan Monnier
  1571  Michael Albinus
   619  Dmitry Gutov
   576  Noam Postavsky

8. After about 900 years of struggle to get X11 forwarding to work, I caught
a stupid mistake and it finally worked.

Process:
Install Xming, run as Admin,  Allow forwarding in Putty, set display to
    localhost:0.0, export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0, go to git directory, run gitk.
Then, I searched for each SHA1 ID that was given and get this show
on the road.
